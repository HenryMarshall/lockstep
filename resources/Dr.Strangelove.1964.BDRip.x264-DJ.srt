1
00:00:41,638 --> 00:00:43,223
<i>For more than a year,</i>

2
00:00:43,307 --> 00:00:48,020
<i>ominous rumors had been privately circulating
among high-level Western leaders</i>

3
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:50,063
<i>that the Soviet Union
had been at work</i>

4
00:00:50,147 --> 00:00:53,567
<i>on what was darkly hinted
to be the ultimate weapon,</i>

5
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,736
<i>a doomsday device.</i>

6
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:59,740
<i>Intelligence sources traced the site
of the top-secret Russian project</i>

7
00:00:59,823 --> 00:01:02,409
<i>to the perpetually
fog-shrouded wasteland</i>

8
00:01:02,493 --> 00:01:05,871
<i>below the Arctic peaks
of the Zhokhov Islands.</i>

9
00:01:05,954 --> 00:01:07,372
<i>What they were building,</i>

10
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:11,335
<i>or why it should be located
in such a remote and desolate place,</i>

11
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:13,420
<i>no one could say.</i>

12
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:45,781
General Ripper, sir.

13
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:47,574
Group Captain Mandrake speaking.

14
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:50,619
- This is General Ripper speaking.
- Yes, sir.

15
00:03:50,702 --> 00:03:52,746
Do you recognize my voice, Mandrake?

16
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,414
I do, sir. Why do you ask?

17
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:56,250
Why do you think I ask?

18
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,920
Well, I don't know, sir. We spoke just
a few moments ago on the phone, didn't we?

19
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:02,381
You don't think I'd ask
if you recognized my voice

20
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:05,175
unless it was pretty damned important,
do you, Mandrake?

21
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:09,012
- No, I don't, sir, no.
- All right, let's see if we can stay on the ball.

22
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,474
Has the wing confirmed
holding at their fail-safe points?

23
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:15,435
Yes, sir, the confirmations
have all just come in.

24
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,188
Very well. Now listen to me carefully.

25
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:21,775
The base is being put on condition red.

26
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:24,278
I want this flashed
to all sections immediately.

27
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:27,656
Condition red, sir, yes. Jolly good idea.
Keeps the men on their toes.

28
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:30,033
Group Captain,
I'm afraid this is not an exercise.

29
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:32,995
Not an exercise, sir?

30
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:36,123
I shouldn't tell you this, Mandrake,

31
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:39,251
but you're a good officer
and you have a right to know.

32
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:41,336
It looks like we're in a shooting war.

33
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:43,630
Oh, hell.

34
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:47,301
- Are the Russians involved, sir?
- Mandrake, that's all I've been told.

35
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:48,969
It just came in on the red phone.

36
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:53,140
My orders are for this base to be sealed tight,
and that's what I mean to do, seal it tight.

37
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:56,643
Now, I want you to transmit plan "R",

38
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:58,729
"R" for Robert, to the wing.

39
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:00,647
plan "R" for Robert.

40
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:02,190
Is it that bad, sir?

41
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:04,818
- It looks like it's pretty hairy.
- Yes, sir.

42
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:06,862
plan "R" for Robert, sir.

43
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:10,157
Now last, and possibly most important,

44
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,410
I want all privately owned radios
to be immediately impounded.

45
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:14,911
Yes, sir.

46
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:18,373
They might be used
to issue instructions to saboteurs.

47
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:21,460
As I previously arranged,
air police will have lists of all owners,

48
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:24,379
and I want every single one of them
collected without exception.

49
00:05:24,463 --> 00:05:25,797
Yes, sir.

50
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:28,008
And after you've done that,
report back to me.

51
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:29,551
Yes, sir.

52
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,746
<i>In order to guard
against surprise nuclear attack,</i>

53
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:03,043
<i>America's Strategic Air Command
maintains a large force of B-52 bombers,</i>

54
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:05,462
<i>airborne 24 hours a day.</i>

55
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:10,467
<i>Each B-52 can deliver
a nuclear bomb load of 50 megatons,</i>

56
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:14,221
<i>equal to 16 times
the total explosive force</i>

57
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:16,348
<i>of all the bombs and shells</i>

58
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:20,060
<i>used by all the armies
in World War II.</i>

59
00:06:20,143 --> 00:06:22,646
<i>Based in America,
the Airborne Alert Force</i>

60
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:26,108
<i>is deployed from the Persian Gulf
to the Arctic Ocean,</i>

61
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:29,111
<i>but they have
one geographical factor in common.</i>

62
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:33,156
<i>They are all two hours
from their targets inside Russia.</i>

63
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:56,031
Major Kong,
I know you'll think this is crazy,

64
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:59,743
but I just got a message from base
over the CRM 114,

65
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:02,579
and it decodes
as Wing Attack plan "R",

66
00:08:03,455 --> 00:08:05,123
"R" for Romeo.

67
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:12,339
Goldie, did you say
Wing Attack plan "R"?

68
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:13,924
Yes, sir, I have.

69
00:08:17,594 --> 00:08:20,805
Goldie, how many times
have I told you guys

70
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:24,100
that I don't want no horsing around
on the airplane?

71
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:26,770
I'm not horsin' around, sir.
That's how it decodes.

72
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:30,106
Well, I've been to one world fair,
a picnic and a rodeo,

73
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,443
and that's the stupidest thing
I ever heard come over a set of earphones.

74
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:35,445
You sure you got today's code?

75
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:40,325
- Yes, sir, it is.
- There's just gotta be somethin' wrong.

76
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:42,118
Wait a second. I'm coming back.

77
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,991
Maybe you'd better
get a confirmation from base.

78
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:22,659
Yes, sir.

79
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:46,433
Major Kong, is it possible
this is some kind of loyalty test?

80
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:50,186
You know, give the go code and then
recall to see who would actually go?

81
00:09:50,854 --> 00:09:53,648
Ain't nobody
ever got the go code yet.

82
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:56,818
And old Ripper
wouldn't be giving us plan "R"

83
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:59,279
unless them Russkies
had already clobbered Washington

84
00:09:59,362 --> 00:10:01,948
and a lot of other towns
with a sneak attack.

85
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:03,199
Yes, sir.

86
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:05,827
Major Kong,
message from base confirmed.

87
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,959
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.

88
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,047
Nuclear combat
toe to toe with the Russkies.

89
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:37,233
Now, look, boys, I ain't much
of a hand at making speeches,

90
00:10:38,443 --> 00:10:40,111
but I got a pretty fair idea

91
00:10:40,195 --> 00:10:43,865
that something doggone important's
going on back there.

92
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:47,494
Now, I got a fair idea
of the kind of personal emotions

93
00:10:47,577 --> 00:10:51,331
that some of you fellows may be thinkin'.

94
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:54,334
Heck, I reckon you wouldn't even
be human beings

95
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:59,005
if you didn't have some pretty strong
personal feelings about nuclear combat.

96
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:01,675
But I want you to remember one thing

97
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:04,386
that folks back home
is a-countin' on ya,

98
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:07,263
and by golly,
we ain't about to let 'em down.

99
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:10,058
Tell you something else.

100
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:16,356
If this thing turns out to be half as
important as I figure it just might be,

101
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:20,360
I'd say that you're all in line
for some important promotions

102
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:24,197
and personal citations
when this thing's over with.

103
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,117
And that goes for ever' last one of you,

104
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,870
regardless of your race, color
or your creed.

105
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:34,791
Now, let's get this thing on the hump.
We got some flyin' to do.

106
00:11:48,304 --> 00:11:50,557
Buck, should I get it?

107
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,350
Yeah, you'll have to.

108
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,233
Hello?

109
00:12:00,316 --> 00:12:01,860
Oh, yes, General Turgidson is here,

110
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:04,946
but I'm afraid he can't come
to the phone at the moment.

111
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:07,240
Well, this is his secretary, Miss Scott.

112
00:12:08,324 --> 00:12:10,368
Freddie, how are you?

113
00:12:10,452 --> 00:12:12,078
Fine. And you?

114
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:16,291
Oh, we were just catching up
on some of the general's paperwork.

115
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:20,503
Well, look, Freddie,
he's very tied up at the moment.

116
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:23,423
I'm afraid he can't come to the phone.

117
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:24,883
Oh, just a minute.

118
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:28,261
General Turgidson.
A Colonel Puntrich calling.

119
00:12:28,344 --> 00:12:30,096
Tell him to call back.

120
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,600
Freddie, the general says
could you call back in a minute or two?

121
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,853
He says it can't wait.

122
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:40,356
Aw, for Pete...
Well, find out what he wants.

123
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,277
Freddie, the thing is, the general
is in the powder room right now.

124
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,571
Could you tell me what it's about?

125
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:49,365
Just a second.

126
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:52,285
Apparently they monitored a transmission
about eight minutes ago

127
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:54,662
from Burpelson Air Force Base.

128
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:57,665
Got it.

129
00:12:57,749 --> 00:13:01,544
It was directed to the 843rd Bomb Wing
on airborne alert.

130
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,966
It decoded as Wing Attack plan "R".

131
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,262
Well, uh, tell him
to call, uh, what's-his-name,

132
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:14,265
Base Commander Ripper.
Do I have to think of everything?

133
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:16,601
The general suggests
you call General Ripper,

134
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:19,145
the 843rd base commander.

135
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:22,482
All communications are dead.

136
00:13:22,565 --> 00:13:25,276
Bull! Tell him to do it himself.

137
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:29,572
Freddie, the general asks
if you could possibly try again yourself.

138
00:13:31,032 --> 00:13:32,158
I see.

139
00:13:32,242 --> 00:13:35,787
He says he's tried personally
several times, but everything is dead.

140
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,581
Even the normal phone lines
are shut down.

141
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:45,672
Give me that.

142
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:47,549
Fred? Buck.

143
00:13:47,632 --> 00:13:49,175
What's it look like?

144
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:51,761
Yeah?

145
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:55,682
Well, are you sure it's plan "R"?

146
00:13:57,592 --> 00:14:00,186
What's cooking
on the threat board?

147
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,605
Nothing? Nothing at all?

148
00:14:05,108 --> 00:14:07,110
I don't like the look of this, Fred.

149
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:11,322
Tell you what you'd better do,
old buddy.

150
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:13,324
You'd better give Elmo
and Charlie a blast,

151
00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:15,702
bump everything up to condition red
and stand by the blower.

152
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:17,245
I'll get back to you.

153
00:14:17,328 --> 00:14:19,414
- What's up?
- Nothin', nothin'.

154
00:14:20,957 --> 00:14:22,542
- Where's my shorts?
- On the floor.

155
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,377
Where are you going?

156
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,212
No place. No place.

157
00:14:26,296 --> 00:14:29,841
I just thought I might, uh, mosey over
to the war room for a few minutes,

158
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:31,342
see what's doing over there.

159
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:34,679
- It's 3:00 in the morning.
- Well, the air force never sleeps.

160
00:14:34,762 --> 00:14:36,514
- Buck, honey.
- Yeah?

161
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:38,600
I'm not sleepy either.

162
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:43,313
I know how it is, baby.

163
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:46,399
Tell you what you do.

164
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:49,736
You just start your countdown,

165
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:54,699
and old Bucky will be back here
before you can say "blast-off".

166
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:59,621
Your commie has no regard
for human life,

167
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:01,497
not even his own,

168
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:04,626
and for this reason, men,
I want to impress upon you

169
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:07,587
the need for extreme watchfulness.

170
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,756
The enemy may come individually

171
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,925
or he may come in strength.

172
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:14,510
He may even come in the uniform
of our own troops.

173
00:15:15,386 --> 00:15:17,931
But however he comes,
we must stop him.

174
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:20,975
We must not allow him
to gain entrance to this base.

175
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:26,272
Now, I am going to give you
three simple rules.

176
00:15:26,356 --> 00:15:30,777
First, trust no one,
whatever his uniform or rank,

177
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,279
unless he is known to you personally.

178
00:15:33,363 --> 00:15:34,364
Second,

179
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:38,993
anyone or anything that approaches
within 200 yards of the perimeter

180
00:15:39,077 --> 00:15:41,287
is to be fired upon.

181
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:42,372
Third,

182
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:47,085
if in doubt, shoot first
and ask questions afterwards.

183
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:50,421
I would sooner accept
a few casualties through accident

184
00:15:50,505 --> 00:15:54,634
than lose the entire base and its personnel
through carelessness.

185
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:58,930
Any variation on these rules
must come from me personally.

186
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:02,642
Now, men, in conclusion,

187
00:16:02,725 --> 00:16:05,103
I would like to say

188
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:10,817
that in the two years it has been my privilege
to be your commanding officer,

189
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,695
I have always expected
the best from you

190
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:16,239
and you have never given me
anything less than that.

191
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:20,159
Today the nation is counting on us.

192
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,331
We are not going to let them down.

193
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:27,250
Good luck to you all.

194
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:59,824
Here's the attack profile, sir.

195
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,146
This is your attack profile.

196
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:33,316
To ensure that the enemy
cannot monitor voice transmission

197
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:35,777
or plant false transmission,

198
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,990
the CRM 114 is to be switched
into all receiver circuits.

199
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:46,871
The emergency base code prefix
is to be set on the dials of the CRM.

200
00:17:46,954 --> 00:17:51,667
This will block any transmission other
than those preceded by a code prefix.

201
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:55,421
Stand by to set code prefix.

202
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,924
Roger. Ready to set code prefix.

203
00:17:58,007 --> 00:17:59,842
Set code prefix.

204
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:10,812
Code prefix set.

205
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:12,605
Lock code prefix.

206
00:18:15,358 --> 00:18:16,651
Code prefix locked.

207
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:20,279
Switch all receiver circuits
to CRM discriminators.

208
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:24,659
All circuits switched
to CRM discriminators.

209
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:26,661
Check auto-destruct circuits.

210
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,874
Auto-destruct circuits checked.

211
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:41,509
Primary target,
the ICBM complex at Laputa.

212
00:18:41,592 --> 00:18:48,099
Target reference,
Yankee Golf Tango 360.

213
00:18:48,182 --> 00:18:50,143
Thirty-megaton nuclear device

214
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:54,313
fused for airburst at 10,000 feet.

215
00:18:54,397 --> 00:18:58,693
Twenty-megaton nuclear device
will be used if first malfunctions.

216
00:18:58,776 --> 00:19:01,571
Otherwise,
proceed to secondary target,

217
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:05,533
missile complex
seven miles east of Barchov.

218
00:19:05,616 --> 00:19:12,039
Target reference,
November Bravo X-ray, 108.

219
00:19:12,123 --> 00:19:14,959
Fused for airburst at 10.

220
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:17,670
Check. 12,000 feet.

221
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:30,516
Excuse me, sir.

222
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,685
Something rather interesting
has just cropped up.

223
00:19:32,768 --> 00:19:36,189
Listen to that. Music.
Civilian broadcasting.

224
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:39,275
I think those fellows in the Pentagon
have given us

225
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,652
some sort of exercise
to test our readiness.

226
00:19:41,736 --> 00:19:43,905
Personally, I think
it's taking things a bit too far.

227
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:46,699
Our fellows will be inside Russian
radar cover in about 20 minutes.

228
00:19:46,782 --> 00:19:49,493
Listen to that. Chockablock
full of stations all churning it out.

229
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:53,622
- Mandrake?
- Yes, sir.

230
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:56,751
I thought I issued instructions
for all radios on this base to be impounded.

231
00:19:56,834 --> 00:20:00,046
Well, you did indeed, sir, and I was
in the process of impounding this very one

232
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:01,631
when I happened to switch it on.

233
00:20:01,714 --> 00:20:05,134
I thought, our fellows hitting Russian radar
cover in 20 minutes, dropping all their stuff,

234
00:20:05,218 --> 00:20:08,804
I'd better tell you because if they do,
it'll cause a bit of a stink, what?

235
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:12,099
Group Captain.

236
00:20:12,183 --> 00:20:15,478
The officer exchange program does not
give you any special prerogatives

237
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:17,396
to question my orders.

238
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,651
Well, I realize that, sir, but I thought
you'd be rather pleased to hear the news.

239
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:24,904
After all, well, let's face it,

240
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:28,574
we don't want to start a nuclear war
unless we really have to, do we?

241
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:30,576
Please sit down.

242
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,163
And turn that thing off.

243
00:20:33,246 --> 00:20:34,414
Yes, sir.

244
00:20:34,497 --> 00:20:36,082
Uh, what about the planes, sir?

245
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:38,584
Surely we must issue
the recall code immediately.

246
00:20:39,502 --> 00:20:42,505
Group Captain, the planes
are not going to be recalled.

247
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:45,591
My attack orders have been issued
and the orders stand.

248
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,178
Well, if you'll excuse me
saying so, sir,

249
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:53,766
that would be, to my way of thinking, rather,
well, a rather odd way of looking at it.

250
00:20:53,849 --> 00:20:56,185
You see, if a Russian attack
was in progress,

251
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:59,480
we would certainly not be hearing
civilian broadcasting.

252
00:21:00,189 --> 00:21:03,109
- Are you certain of that, Mandrake?
- I'm absolutely positive about that, sir.

253
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:05,194
And what if it is true?

254
00:21:06,195 --> 00:21:09,198
Well, I'm afraid I'm still not with you, sir,
because, I mean...

255
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:12,910
If a Russian attack
was not in progress,

256
00:21:12,994 --> 00:21:15,079
then your use of plan "R",

257
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:17,665
in fact, your orders to the entire wing...

258
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:27,174
Well, I would say, sir,
that there was something...

259
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:30,094
dreadfully wrong somewhere.

260
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,597
Now, why don't you just take it easy,
Group Captain,

261
00:21:33,681 --> 00:21:36,475
and please make me a drink
of grain alcohol and rainwater

262
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,020
and help yourself
to whatever you'd like.

263
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:49,530
General Ripper, sir,

264
00:21:49,613 --> 00:21:51,991
as an officer in Her Majesty's Air Force,

265
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:55,328
it is my clear duty
under the present circumstances

266
00:21:55,411 --> 00:21:58,789
to issue the recall code
upon my own authority

267
00:21:58,873 --> 00:22:00,499
and bring back the wing.

268
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,585
If you'll excuse me, sir.

269
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:13,846
I'm afraid, sir, I must ask you
for the key and the recall code.

270
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:15,681
Have you got them handy, sir?

271
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:18,184
I told you to take it easy,
Group Captain.

272
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:20,853
There's nothing anybody
can do about this thing now.

273
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:23,356
I'm the only person who knows
the three-letter code group.

274
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:26,108
Then I must insist, sir,
that you give them to me.

275
00:22:35,117 --> 00:22:39,246
Do I take it, sir, that you are threatening
a brother officer with a gun?

276
00:22:40,456 --> 00:22:42,458
Mandrake,

277
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,127
I suppose it never occurred to you

278
00:22:45,711 --> 00:22:48,297
that while we're chatting here so enjoyably,

279
00:22:49,256 --> 00:22:52,385
a decision is being made by the president

280
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,472
and the joint chiefs
in the war room at the Pentagon.

281
00:22:57,431 --> 00:23:02,144
And when they realize there is
no possibility of recalling the wing,

282
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:06,315
there will be only
one course of action open.

283
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,235
Total commitment.

284
00:23:11,654 --> 00:23:16,325
Mandrake, do you recall what
Clemenceau once said about war?

285
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,787
Uh, no, I don't think I do, sir, no.

286
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:24,917
He said war was too important
to be left to the generals.

287
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,839
When he said that 50 years ago,

288
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:31,674
he might have been right.

289
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:34,093
But today...

290
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,472
war is too important
to be left to politicians.

291
00:23:38,556 --> 00:23:41,100
They have neither the time,

292
00:23:41,183 --> 00:23:42,935
the training

293
00:23:43,018 --> 00:23:45,938
nor the inclination for strategic thought.

294
00:23:49,817 --> 00:23:52,361
I can no longer sit back and allow

295
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:55,614
Communist infiltration,

296
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:57,533
Communist indoctrination,

297
00:23:58,534 --> 00:24:00,453
Communist subversion

298
00:24:01,662 --> 00:24:04,748
and the international Communist conspiracy

299
00:24:05,749 --> 00:24:08,461
to sap and impurify

300
00:24:08,544 --> 00:24:11,630
all of our precious bodily fluids.

301
00:24:18,137 --> 00:24:19,805
Staines, is everybody here?

302
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:22,183
Mr. President,
the secretary of state is in Vietnam,

303
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:26,312
the secretary of defense is in Laos
and the vice-president is in Mexico City.

304
00:24:26,896 --> 00:24:29,482
We can establish contact with them
at any time if it's necessary.

305
00:24:29,565 --> 00:24:31,484
The undersecretaries
are all here, of course.

306
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:34,487
Right. Now, General Turgidson,
what's going on here?

307
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,573
Mr. President,

308
00:24:38,616 --> 00:24:42,286
about 35 minutes ago

309
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:44,038
General Jack Ripper,

310
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:47,917
the commanding general
of Burpelson Air Force Base,

311
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:52,213
issued an order
to the 34 B-52's of his wing,

312
00:24:52,296 --> 00:24:54,507
which were airborne at the time

313
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,677
as part of a special exercise
we were holding called Operation Dropkick.

314
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:04,391
Now, it appears that the order
called for the planes to

315
00:25:04,475 --> 00:25:06,852
attack their targets inside Russia.

316
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:11,190
The planes are fully armed
with nuclear weapons

317
00:25:11,273 --> 00:25:14,735
with an average load
of 40 megatons each.

318
00:25:14,818 --> 00:25:19,281
Now, the central display of Russia
will indicate the position of the planes.

319
00:25:20,658 --> 00:25:23,911
The triangles are their primary targets.

320
00:25:23,994 --> 00:25:27,957
The squares are their secondary targets.

321
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,170
The aircraft will begin penetrating
Russian radar cover within 25 minutes.

322
00:25:35,464 --> 00:25:38,801
General Turgidson, I find this
very difficult to understand.

323
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:41,637
I was under the impression
that I was the only one in authority

324
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,265
to order the use of nuclear weapons.

325
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:46,892
That's right, sir.

326
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:49,395
You are the only person
authorized to do so.

327
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:53,691
And although I hate to judge
before all the facts are in,

328
00:25:53,774 --> 00:25:57,570
it's beginning to look like General Ripper
exceeded his authority.

329
00:25:57,653 --> 00:26:01,699
It certainly does, far beyond the point
I would have imagined possible.

330
00:26:02,616 --> 00:26:06,161
Well, perhaps you're forgetting
the provisions of plan "R", sir.

331
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:08,122
Plan "R"?

332
00:26:09,456 --> 00:26:12,918
Plan "R" is an emergency war plan

333
00:26:13,002 --> 00:26:15,045
in which a lower-echelon commander

334
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:18,841
may order nuclear retaliation
after a sneak attack

335
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:22,261
if the normal chain of command
has been disrupted.

336
00:26:22,344 --> 00:26:25,431
You approved it, sir.
You must remember.

337
00:26:26,473 --> 00:26:30,769
Surely you must recall, sir, when
Senator Buford made that big hassle

338
00:26:30,853 --> 00:26:33,731
about our deterrent lacking credibility.

339
00:26:33,814 --> 00:26:38,652
The idea was for plan "R" to be
a sort of retaliatory safeguard.

340
00:26:38,736 --> 00:26:40,613
A safeguard?

341
00:26:40,696 --> 00:26:43,949
Well, I admit the human element
seems to have failed us here.

342
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:47,328
But the idea was to discourage
the Russkies from any hope

343
00:26:47,411 --> 00:26:50,039
that they could knock out Washington,
and yourself, sir,

344
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:52,124
as part of a general sneak attack

345
00:26:52,207 --> 00:26:56,295
and escape retaliation because of
lack of proper command and control.

346
00:26:56,378 --> 00:26:59,173
Well, I assume then that the planes
will return automatically

347
00:26:59,256 --> 00:27:01,300
once they reach their fail-safe points.

348
00:27:01,383 --> 00:27:03,135
Well, no, sir, I'm afraid not.

349
00:27:03,218 --> 00:27:06,847
You see, the planes were holding
at their fail-safe points,

350
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,932
when the go code was issued.

351
00:27:09,016 --> 00:27:10,976
Now, once they fly beyond fail-safe,

352
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,604
they do not require
a second order to proceed.

353
00:27:13,687 --> 00:27:15,648
They will continue
until they reach their targets.

354
00:27:15,731 --> 00:27:18,734
Then why haven't you radioed the planes
countermanding the go code?

355
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:23,447
Well, I'm afraid we're unable to
communicate with any of the aircraft.

356
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,240
Why?

357
00:27:25,324 --> 00:27:28,035
As you may recall, sir,

358
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:31,830
one of the provisions
of plan "R" provides

359
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:36,543
that once the go code is received

360
00:27:36,627 --> 00:27:40,214
the normal SSB radios in the aircraft

361
00:27:40,297 --> 00:27:42,341
are switched into
a special coded device

362
00:27:42,424 --> 00:27:45,552
which, I believe,
is designated as CRM 114.

363
00:27:45,636 --> 00:27:49,932
Now, in order to prevent the enemy
from issuing fake or confusing orders,

364
00:27:50,015 --> 00:27:54,061
CRM 114 is designed
not to receive at all

365
00:27:54,144 --> 00:27:59,149
unless the message is preceded by
the correct three-letter code group prefix.

366
00:28:00,317 --> 00:28:02,319
Then do you mean to tell me,
General Turgidson,

367
00:28:02,403 --> 00:28:05,114
that you will be unable
to recall the aircraft?

368
00:28:05,197 --> 00:28:06,740
That's about the size of it, sir.

369
00:28:06,824 --> 00:28:11,203
However, we are plowing through every
possible three-letter combination of the code.

370
00:28:11,286 --> 00:28:16,250
But since there are,
17,000 permutations,

371
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:20,087
it's going to take us about
two and a half days to transmit them all.

372
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,923
How soon did you say the planes
would penetrate Russian radar cover?

373
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:24,925
About 18 minutes from now, sir.

374
00:28:25,008 --> 00:28:27,845
- Are you in contact with General Ripper?
- No, sir, no.

375
00:28:27,928 --> 00:28:31,473
General Ripper sealed off the base
and cut off all communications.

376
00:28:31,557 --> 00:28:33,225
Where did you get all this information?

377
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:36,770
General Ripper called
Strategic Air Command headquarters

378
00:28:36,854 --> 00:28:39,106
shortly after he issued the go code.

379
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:43,026
I have a portion of the transcript of that
conversation, if you'd like me to read it.

380
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,403
Read it.

381
00:28:46,697 --> 00:28:50,159
The duty officer asked General Ripper
to confirm the fact

382
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:53,787
that he had issued
the go code and he said...

383
00:28:53,871 --> 00:28:58,250
Yes, gentlemen, they are on their way
and no one can bring them back.

384
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:01,044
For the sake of our country
and our way of life,

385
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:03,839
I suggest you get the rest of SAC
in after them.

386
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:08,177
Otherwise we will be totally
destroyed by Red retaliation.

387
00:29:08,844 --> 00:29:11,597
My boys will give you
the best kind of start,

388
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,224
1,400 megatons worth,

389
00:29:14,308 --> 00:29:17,811
and you sure as hell
won't stop them now.

390
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:20,689
So let's get going.
There's no other choice.

391
00:29:20,773 --> 00:29:23,609
God willing, we will prevail,

392
00:29:23,692 --> 00:29:25,694
in peace and freedom from fear,

393
00:29:26,195 --> 00:29:29,114
and in true health
through the purity

394
00:29:29,198 --> 00:29:31,617
and essence of our natural...

395
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:34,620
fluids.

396
00:29:35,537 --> 00:29:37,206
God bless you all.

397
00:29:39,374 --> 00:29:41,168
Then he hung up.

398
00:29:42,252 --> 00:29:45,714
We're still trying to figure out
the meaning of that last phrase, sir.

399
00:29:45,798 --> 00:29:48,217
There's nothing to figure out,
General Turgidson.

400
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,302
This man is obviously a psychotic.

401
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:53,514
Well, I'd like to hold off judgment
on a thing like that, sir,

402
00:29:53,597 --> 00:29:55,474
until all the facts are in.

403
00:29:55,557 --> 00:29:59,978
General Turgidson, when you instituted
the human reliability tests,

404
00:30:00,062 --> 00:30:04,149
you assured me there was no possibility
of such a thing ever occurring.

405
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:09,988
Well, I don't think it's quite fair
to condemn a whole program

406
00:30:10,072 --> 00:30:11,949
because of a single slip-up, sir.

407
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,494
I want to speak to General Ripper
on the telephone personally.

408
00:30:15,577 --> 00:30:17,079
I'm afraid that's impossible, sir.

409
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:20,958
General Turgidson, I am becoming
less and less interested

410
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:24,253
in your estimates
of what is possible and impossible.

411
00:30:25,921 --> 00:30:28,423
- General Faceman.
- Yes, sir.

412
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:31,009
Are there any army units
stationed anywhere near Burpelson?

413
00:30:31,093 --> 00:30:33,262
I'll just check, sir.

414
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:39,142
Hello.

415
00:30:40,894 --> 00:30:44,523
I told you never to call me here.
Don't you know where I am?

416
00:30:46,525 --> 00:30:49,194
Now look, baby,
I can't talk to you now.

417
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:51,154
My president needs me.

418
00:30:51,864 --> 00:30:55,284
- Of course Bucky would rather be with you.
- What do you think about civil defense?

419
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,872
Why, of course, it isn't only physical.

420
00:30:59,955 --> 00:31:02,332
I deeply respect you
as a human being.

421
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:05,127
Someday I'm going to make you
Mrs. Buck Turgidson.

422
00:31:06,587 --> 00:31:09,631
All... Listen, hon...
You go back to sleep, hon.

423
00:31:09,715 --> 00:31:12,551
Bucky'll be back there
just as soon as he can.

424
00:31:12,634 --> 00:31:13,719
All right.

425
00:31:13,802 --> 00:31:16,972
Listen, shug, don't forget
to say your prayers.

426
00:31:24,354 --> 00:31:26,398
Apparently,

427
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:29,651
the 23rd Airborne Division
is stationed seven miles away

428
00:31:29,735 --> 00:31:31,236
at Alvarado.

429
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,406
General Faceman,
I want them to enter the base,

430
00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:37,951
locate General Ripper and put him
in immediate telephone contact with me.

431
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:39,536
Yes, sir.

432
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,915
Mr. President, if I may advise,

433
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:45,375
under condition red,
it is standard procedure

434
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:47,377
that the base be sealed off

435
00:31:47,461 --> 00:31:50,130
and the base defended
by base security troops.

436
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:54,176
Any force trying to enter there would
certainly encounter very heavy casualties.

437
00:31:54,968 --> 00:31:59,097
General Turgidson, with all due respect
for your defense team,

438
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:01,683
my boys can brush 'em aside
without too much trouble.

439
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,439
Mr. President, there are one or two points
I'd like to make if I may.

440
00:32:08,357 --> 00:32:09,858
Go ahead, General.

441
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,948
One, our hopes for recalling
the 843rd Bomb Wing

442
00:32:16,031 --> 00:32:20,452
are quickly being reduced
to a very low order of probability.

443
00:32:20,535 --> 00:32:23,330
Two, in less than 15 minutes from now

444
00:32:23,413 --> 00:32:26,541
the Russkies will be making
radar contact with the planes.

445
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:30,420
Three, when they do
they are gonna go absolutely ape

446
00:32:30,504 --> 00:32:32,664
and they're gonna strike back
with everything they got.

447
00:32:32,923 --> 00:32:36,259
Four, if, prior to this time,

448
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:39,763
we have done nothing further
to suppress their retaliatory capabilities,

449
00:32:39,846 --> 00:32:42,975
we will suffer virtual annihilation.

450
00:32:43,058 --> 00:32:44,726
Now...

451
00:32:46,436 --> 00:32:47,938
five.

452
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:51,400
If, on the other hand,

453
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,613
we were to immediately launch
an all-out and coordinated attack

454
00:32:56,697 --> 00:32:58,448
on all their air fields
and missile bases,

455
00:32:58,532 --> 00:33:01,660
we'd stand a damn good chance
of catching them with their pants down.

456
00:33:01,743 --> 00:33:04,162
Hell, we've got a five-to-one
missile superiority as it is.

457
00:33:04,246 --> 00:33:07,082
We could easily assign three missiles
to every target

458
00:33:07,165 --> 00:33:10,460
and still have a very effective reserve force
for any other contingencies.

459
00:33:10,544 --> 00:33:12,170
Now, six,

460
00:33:12,254 --> 00:33:15,841
an unofficial study
which we undertook of this eventuality

461
00:33:15,924 --> 00:33:20,804
indicated that we would destroy 90%
of their nuclear capabilities.

462
00:33:20,887 --> 00:33:23,056
We would, therefore, prevail

463
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,269
and suffer only modest and acceptable
civilian casualties from their remaining force,

464
00:33:27,352 --> 00:33:30,856
which would be badly damaged
and uncoordinated.

465
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:34,359
General, it is the avowed policy
of our country

466
00:33:34,443 --> 00:33:36,737
never to strike first
with nuclear weapons.

467
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,905
Well, Mr. President, I would say

468
00:33:38,989 --> 00:33:41,533
that General Ripper
has already invalidated that policy.

469
00:33:41,616 --> 00:33:46,079
That was not an act of national policy
and there are still alternatives left open to us.

470
00:33:46,955 --> 00:33:48,373
Mr. President,

471
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:52,085
we are rapidly approaching
a moment of truth,

472
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:54,963
both for ourselves as human beings
and for the life of our nation.

473
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:57,299
Now, truth is not always
a pleasant thing,

474
00:33:57,966 --> 00:34:00,385
but it is necessary now
to make a choice,

475
00:34:00,469 --> 00:34:03,180
to choose between
two admittedly regrettable,

476
00:34:03,263 --> 00:34:06,725
but nevertheless distinguishable
postwar environments,

477
00:34:06,808 --> 00:34:08,977
one, where you got
20 million people killed

478
00:34:09,061 --> 00:34:11,730
and the other where you got
150 million people killed.

479
00:34:11,813 --> 00:34:14,733
You're talking about mass murder,
General, not war.

480
00:34:14,816 --> 00:34:18,320
Mr. President, I'm not saying
we wouldn't get our hair mussed.

481
00:34:18,403 --> 00:34:22,741
But I do say no more than
10 to 20 million killed tops,

482
00:34:22,824 --> 00:34:25,160
depending on the breaks.

483
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:29,247
I will not go down in history as the greatest
mass murderer since Adolf Hitler.

484
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:31,249
Perhaps it might be better,
Mr. President,

485
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:33,376
if you were more concerned
with the American people

486
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,295
than with your image in the history books.

487
00:34:35,378 --> 00:34:39,674
General Turgidson, I think I've heard quite
sufficient from you, thank you very much.

488
00:34:41,176 --> 00:34:43,428
Mr. President, they have
the ambassador waiting upstairs.

489
00:34:43,512 --> 00:34:44,763
Oh, good. Any difficulty?

490
00:34:44,846 --> 00:34:47,099
They say he's having a fit
about that squad of MP's.

491
00:34:47,182 --> 00:34:49,768
Yes, well, that can't be helped.
Have him brought down here straight away.

492
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:51,311
Yes, sir.

493
00:34:51,394 --> 00:34:53,980
Is that the Russian ambassador
you're talking about?

494
00:34:54,064 --> 00:34:56,191
Yes, it is, General.

495
00:34:58,235 --> 00:35:01,029
Am I to understand
the Russian ambassador

496
00:35:01,113 --> 00:35:03,698
is to be admitted entrance
to the war room?

497
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:06,660
That is correct.
He is here on my orders.

498
00:35:08,203 --> 00:35:11,498
I don't know
exactly how to put this, sir,

499
00:35:11,581 --> 00:35:14,501
but are you aware of what a serious
breach of security that would be?

500
00:35:14,584 --> 00:35:19,506
I mean, he'll see everything.
He'll see the big board!

501
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:22,634
That is precisely the idea, General.

502
00:35:22,717 --> 00:35:25,053
That is precisely the idea.

503
00:35:26,638 --> 00:35:29,891
Staines, get Premier Kissoff
on the hot line.

504
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:40,861
Survival kit contents check.

505
00:35:41,736 --> 00:35:46,324
In them you will find one
.45 caliber automatic,

506
00:35:46,408 --> 00:35:49,119
two boxes ammunition,

507
00:35:49,202 --> 00:35:52,497
four days concentrated
emergency rations,

508
00:35:52,581 --> 00:35:55,876
one drug issue
containing antibiotics,

509
00:35:55,959 --> 00:36:00,338
morphine, vitamin pills, pep pills,

510
00:36:00,422 --> 00:36:04,176
sleeping pills, tranquilizer pills,

511
00:36:04,259 --> 00:36:09,097
one miniature combination
Russian phrase book and Bible,

512
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:12,142
$100 in rubles,

513
00:36:12,225 --> 00:36:14,394
$100 in gold,

514
00:36:14,477 --> 00:36:19,107
nine packs of chewing gum,
one issue of prophylactics,

515
00:36:19,191 --> 00:36:23,236
three lipsticks,
three pair of nylon stockings.

516
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:28,200
Shoot, a fella could have a pretty good
weekend in Vegas with all that stuff.

517
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:36,541
- You don't have any fresh fish?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

518
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:38,710
- Your eggs then. They are fresh?
- Oh, yes, sir.

519
00:36:38,793 --> 00:36:40,420
I will have poached eggs.

520
00:36:40,503 --> 00:36:42,756
And bring me some cigars, please.
Havana cigars.

521
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:44,716
- And that will be all for you, sir?
- Yes.

522
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:46,301
Then I'll see to it right away.

523
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:49,554
Try one of these Jamaican cigars,
Ambassador. They're pretty good.

524
00:36:49,638 --> 00:36:53,141
Thank you, no. I do not support
the work of imperialist stooges.

525
00:36:53,225 --> 00:36:55,894
Only commie stooges, huh?

526
00:36:55,977 --> 00:36:57,562
Mr. President.

527
00:36:59,231 --> 00:37:02,859
You gonna let that lousy commie punk
vomit all over us like this?

528
00:37:02,943 --> 00:37:06,488
Mr. President, we haven't been able
to reach Premier Kissoff in the Kremlin.

529
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:10,116
They say they don't know where he is
and he won't be back for another two hours.

530
00:37:11,284 --> 00:37:13,495
- Try B86543, Moscow.
- Yes, sir.

531
00:37:13,578 --> 00:37:15,789
You would never have found him
through his office, Mr. President.

532
00:37:15,872 --> 00:37:19,709
Our premier is a man of the people,
but he is also a man, if you follow my meaning.

533
00:37:19,793 --> 00:37:21,586
- Fine.
- Degenerate atheistic commie.

534
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,921
What did you say?

535
00:37:23,004 --> 00:37:25,674
I said Premier Kissoff
is a degenerate atheistic commie!

536
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:27,968
Mr. President, I formally request
that you have this ignorant...

537
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:29,469
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

538
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:32,555
Mr. President!
I think they're trying the number.

539
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:39,604
You filthy bully! You filthy brute!

540
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:43,984
You war-mongering bully!

541
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:47,195
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here!
This is the war room!

542
00:37:47,279 --> 00:37:49,948
What is going on here?
I demand an explanation.

543
00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:53,785
This clumsy fool tried to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

544
00:37:53,868 --> 00:37:56,871
Yeah, you bet your sweets, Mr. Commie.
Look at this, Mr. President.

545
00:37:56,955 --> 00:38:00,792
This lousy commie rat was taking pictures
with this thing. Of the big board!

546
00:38:01,751 --> 00:38:03,670
Mr. Ambassador!

547
00:38:03,753 --> 00:38:05,213
This clumsy fool

548
00:38:05,297 --> 00:38:07,924
attempted to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

549
00:38:08,008 --> 00:38:10,969
That's a damn lie!
I saw him with my own eyes!

550
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:12,512
Gentlemen, this is outrageous.

551
00:38:12,595 --> 00:38:15,265
I've never heard of such behavior
in the war room before.

552
00:38:15,348 --> 00:38:17,851
Mr. President,
I think they're getting him on the line.

553
00:38:45,754 --> 00:38:47,714
You sure gotta hand it to those commies.

554
00:38:47,797 --> 00:38:49,466
Yeah.

555
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:52,344
Gee, those trucks sure look like
the real thing, don't they?

556
00:38:52,427 --> 00:38:54,387
I wonder where they got 'em from.

557
00:38:54,471 --> 00:38:56,723
Probably bought them from the army
as war surplus.

558
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:04,105
Okay, open up at 200 yards.

559
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:05,583
Tell him where you are and that you'll enter
the conversation if I say anything untrue,

560
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:09,337
but please don't tell him
anything more than that.

561
00:40:09,421 --> 00:40:12,757
Alexi. Alexi, please, I beg you.

562
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:16,261
I don't have a phone.

563
00:40:16,344 --> 00:40:18,346
Give him your phone, Frank.

564
00:40:45,832 --> 00:40:47,333
I've done as you asked.

565
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:50,295
Be careful, Mr. President.
I think he is drunk.

566
00:40:53,173 --> 00:40:57,260
Hello?
Hello, D... Hello, Dmitri.

567
00:40:57,969 --> 00:40:59,762
Listen, I can't hear too well.

568
00:40:59,846 --> 00:41:03,057
Do you suppose you could
turn the music down just a little?

569
00:41:03,892 --> 00:41:05,560
Oh, that's much better.

570
00:41:05,643 --> 00:41:08,313
Yes. Yes.

571
00:41:09,397 --> 00:41:12,150
Fine. I can hear you now, Dmitri.

572
00:41:12,233 --> 00:41:15,695
Clear and plain and coming through fine.

573
00:41:15,778 --> 00:41:18,406
I'm coming through fine too, eh?
Good.

574
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,283
Then...

575
00:41:20,366 --> 00:41:23,828
Well, then as you say,
we're both coming through fine.

576
00:41:23,912 --> 00:41:27,916
Good. Well, it's good
that you're fine and I'm fine.

577
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,960
I agree with you.
It's great to be fine.

578
00:41:32,962 --> 00:41:35,298
Now then, Dmitri,

579
00:41:35,381 --> 00:41:37,175
you know how

580
00:41:37,258 --> 00:41:40,887
we've always talked
about the possibility

581
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,723
of something going wrong
with the bomb.

582
00:41:45,016 --> 00:41:46,893
The bomb, Dmitri.

583
00:41:48,144 --> 00:41:50,188
The hydrogen bomb.

584
00:41:50,939 --> 00:41:53,816
Well, now, what happened is

585
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,444
one of our base commanders,

586
00:41:56,528 --> 00:41:58,196
he had a sort of...

587
00:41:58,279 --> 00:42:01,491
Well, he went
a little funny in the head.

588
00:42:01,574 --> 00:42:04,661
You know, just a little... funny.

589
00:42:04,744 --> 00:42:08,957
And he went and did a silly thing.

590
00:42:09,707 --> 00:42:11,292
Well, I'll tell you what he did.

591
00:42:11,376 --> 00:42:13,461
He ordered his planes...

592
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:17,340
to attack your country.

593
00:42:17,423 --> 00:42:20,426
Well, let me finish, Dmitri.

594
00:42:21,177 --> 00:42:23,388
Let me finish, Dmitri.

595
00:42:23,471 --> 00:42:26,558
Well, listen,
how do you think I feel about it?

596
00:42:26,641 --> 00:42:29,602
Can you imagine
how I feel about it, Dmitri?

597
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:34,857
Why do you think I'm calling you?
Just to say hello?

598
00:42:36,317 --> 00:42:38,695
Of course I like to speak to you.

599
00:42:38,778 --> 00:42:41,239
Of course I like to say hello.

600
00:42:41,322 --> 00:42:43,449
Not now, but any time, Dmitri.

601
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:47,745
I'm just calling up to tell you
something terrible has happened.

602
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:50,790
It's a friendly call.
Of course it's a friendly call.

603
00:42:50,873 --> 00:42:55,253
Listen, if it wasn't friendly,
you probably wouldn't have even got it.

604
00:42:57,714 --> 00:43:01,593
They will not reach their targets
for at least another hour.

605
00:43:02,302 --> 00:43:05,471
I am positive, Dmitri.

606
00:43:05,555 --> 00:43:09,726
Listen, I've been all over this
with your ambassador. It is not a trick.

607
00:43:10,727 --> 00:43:12,145
Well, I'll tell you.

608
00:43:12,228 --> 00:43:15,898
We'd like to give your air staff
a complete rundown on the targets,

609
00:43:15,982 --> 00:43:19,319
the flight plans
and the defensive systems of the planes.

610
00:43:19,402 --> 00:43:23,114
Yes, I mean, if we are unable
to recall the planes,

611
00:43:23,197 --> 00:43:26,451
then I'd say that,

612
00:43:26,534 --> 00:43:31,623
well, we're just going to have to
help you destroy them, Dmitri.

613
00:43:32,957 --> 00:43:34,917
I know they're our boys.

614
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:38,421
All right. Well, listen.
Now, who should we call?

615
00:43:40,048 --> 00:43:43,134
Who should we call, Dmitri?
The... What was... The people...

616
00:43:43,217 --> 00:43:45,219
Sorry, you faded away there.

617
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:49,057
The People's Central Air Defense
headquarters.

618
00:43:49,891 --> 00:43:51,351
Where is that, Dmitri?

619
00:43:52,226 --> 00:43:54,103
In Omsk. Right.

620
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,731
Yes.

621
00:43:56,814 --> 00:43:58,816
Oh, you'll call them first, will you?

622
00:44:01,194 --> 00:44:04,197
Listen, do you happen to have
the phone number on you, Dmitri?

623
00:44:05,073 --> 00:44:08,451
What? I see.
Just ask for Omsk information.

624
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:13,331
I'm sorry too, Dmitri.

625
00:44:13,414 --> 00:44:15,208
I'm very sorry.

626
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:19,170
All right, you're sorrier than I am.
But I am sorry as well.

627
00:44:21,506 --> 00:44:23,675
I am as sorry as you are, Dmitri.

628
00:44:23,758 --> 00:44:25,677
Don't say that you're
more sorry than I am,

629
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,888
because I am capable of being
just as sorry as you are.

630
00:44:28,971 --> 00:44:32,266
So we're both sorry, all right?
All right.

631
00:44:33,434 --> 00:44:37,271
Yes, he's right here. Yes, he wants
to talk to you. Just a second.

632
00:44:50,993 --> 00:44:54,122
What?

633
00:45:10,388 --> 00:45:12,181
What?

634
00:45:12,265 --> 00:45:13,391
What is it? What?

635
00:45:13,474 --> 00:45:14,976
The fools.

636
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:17,103
The mad fools.

637
00:45:17,854 --> 00:45:20,148
What's happened?

638
00:45:20,231 --> 00:45:22,650
The Doomsday Machine.

639
00:45:22,734 --> 00:45:25,278
The Doomsday Machine?
What is that?

640
00:45:25,361 --> 00:45:30,199
A device which will destroy
all human and animal life on earth.

641
00:45:30,825 --> 00:45:32,869
All human and animal life?

642
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,177
Mandrake.

643
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,429
Yes, Jack?

644
00:45:51,512 --> 00:45:54,515
Have you ever seen a commie
drink a glass of water?

645
00:45:55,224 --> 00:45:57,185
Well, no, I...

646
00:45:57,268 --> 00:45:59,479
I can't say I have, Jack.

647
00:46:00,897 --> 00:46:03,983
Vodka.
That's what they drink, isn't it?

648
00:46:04,066 --> 00:46:05,777
Never water.

649
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,278
Well, I...

650
00:46:07,361 --> 00:46:10,239
I believe that's what
they drink, Jack, yes.

651
00:46:10,323 --> 00:46:13,785
On no account
will a commie ever drink water.

652
00:46:13,868 --> 00:46:15,870
And not without good reason.

653
00:46:17,288 --> 00:46:19,916
Oh, yes.

654
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:23,336
I can't quite...

655
00:46:23,419 --> 00:46:26,339
see what you're getting at, Jack.

656
00:46:26,422 --> 00:46:28,508
Water.
That's what I'm getting at.

657
00:46:28,591 --> 00:46:30,051
Water.

658
00:46:31,052 --> 00:46:34,555
Mandrake,
water is the source of all life.

659
00:46:35,973 --> 00:46:38,601
Seven-tenths
of this earth's surface is water.

660
00:46:39,602 --> 00:46:41,604
Why, do you realize that...

661
00:46:43,064 --> 00:46:45,608
70% of you is water?

662
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:47,652
Oh, how odd.

663
00:46:47,735 --> 00:46:49,487
And as human beings,

664
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:52,698
you and I need fresh, pure water

665
00:46:52,782 --> 00:46:55,701
to replenish
our precious bodily fluids.

666
00:46:55,785 --> 00:46:57,995
- Yes.
- Are you beginning to understand?

667
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,872
Yes.

668
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,044
Mandrake.

669
00:47:06,671 --> 00:47:09,549
Mandrake, have you
never wondered why

670
00:47:09,632 --> 00:47:12,969
I drink only distilled water,
or rainwater,

671
00:47:13,052 --> 00:47:15,513
and only pure grain alcohol?

672
00:47:16,389 --> 00:47:19,600
Well, I... it did occur to me Jack, yes.

673
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,312
Have you ever heard of a thing
called fluoridation?

674
00:47:23,396 --> 00:47:25,690
Fluoridation of water?

675
00:47:25,773 --> 00:47:28,276
Uh, yes. I have heard of that, Jack.

676
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:29,861
Yes. Yes.

677
00:47:29,944 --> 00:47:31,612
Well, do you know what it is?

678
00:47:31,696 --> 00:47:34,824
No. No, I don't know what it is, no.

679
00:47:34,907 --> 00:47:36,868
Do you realize

680
00:47:36,951 --> 00:47:38,953
that fluoridation

681
00:47:39,036 --> 00:47:41,873
is the most monstrously conceived

682
00:47:41,956 --> 00:47:44,750
and dangerous Communist plot
we have ever had to face?

683
00:47:51,382 --> 00:47:53,134
Two can play at that game, soldier.

684
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,516
That's nice shooting, soldier!

685
00:48:25,374 --> 00:48:27,501
Mandrake, come here.

686
00:48:27,585 --> 00:48:29,462
Are you calling me, Jack?

687
00:48:29,545 --> 00:48:31,923
Come over here
and help me with this belt.

688
00:48:33,382 --> 00:48:35,051
I...

689
00:48:35,134 --> 00:48:38,012
I haven't had very much experience,
you know,

690
00:48:38,095 --> 00:48:40,973
with those sort of machines, Jack.

691
00:48:41,057 --> 00:48:44,268
I've only ever pressed a button
in my old Spitfire.

692
00:48:44,352 --> 00:48:46,771
Mandrake, in the name of Her Majesty
and the Continental Congress,

693
00:48:46,854 --> 00:48:48,606
come here and feed me this belt, boy.

694
00:48:48,689 --> 00:48:52,360
Jack. I'd love to come, but

695
00:48:52,443 --> 00:48:55,905
what's happened, you see,
the string in my leg's gone.

696
00:48:57,281 --> 00:48:59,033
- The what?
- The string.

697
00:48:59,116 --> 00:49:01,243
I never told you, but you see...

698
00:49:01,327 --> 00:49:05,164
Got a gammy leg.
Oh, dear. Gone, shot off.

699
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:10,962
Mandrake. Come over here.
The Red Coats are coming. Come on.

700
00:49:12,004 --> 00:49:16,384
When it is detonated, it will produce
enough lethal radioactive fallout

701
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:19,595
so that within 10 months,
the surface of the Earth

702
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:21,555
will be as dead as the moon.

703
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:24,433
Ah, come on, de Sadesky.
That's ridiculous.

704
00:49:24,517 --> 00:49:28,646
Our studies show that even the worst fallout
is down to a safe level after two weeks.

705
00:49:28,729 --> 00:49:32,358
You've obviously never heard
of Cobalt Thorium G.

706
00:49:32,441 --> 00:49:33,943
Well, what about it?

707
00:49:34,026 --> 00:49:37,780
Cobalt Thorium G has
a radioactive half-life of 93 years.

708
00:49:37,863 --> 00:49:40,992
If you take, say, 50 H-bombs
in the hundred megaton range

709
00:49:41,075 --> 00:49:43,452
and jacket them with Cobalt Thorium G,

710
00:49:43,536 --> 00:49:48,124
when they are exploded,
they will produce a doomsday shroud,

711
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:50,584
a lethal cloud of radioactivity

712
00:49:50,668 --> 00:49:55,047
which will encircle the Earth
for 93 years.

713
00:49:55,131 --> 00:49:57,258
Oh, what a load of commie bull.

714
00:49:57,341 --> 00:49:58,843
I mean, after all...

715
00:49:59,885 --> 00:50:02,513
I'm afraid I don't understand
something, Alexi.

716
00:50:02,596 --> 00:50:06,350
Is the premier threatening to explode this
if our planes carry out their attack?

717
00:50:06,434 --> 00:50:08,936
No, sir.
It is not a thing a sane man would do.

718
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,856
The Doomsday Machine is designed
to trigger itself automatically.

719
00:50:11,939 --> 00:50:14,191
- But surely you can disarm it somehow?
- No.

720
00:50:14,275 --> 00:50:18,362
It is designed to explode if any attempt
is ever made to untrigger it.

721
00:50:18,446 --> 00:50:20,948
- Automatically?
- It's an obvious commie trick, Mr. President.

722
00:50:21,032 --> 00:50:23,576
We're wasting valuable ti...
Look at the big board.

723
00:50:23,659 --> 00:50:25,578
They're getting ready to clobber us.

724
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:28,164
But this is absolute madness,
Ambassador.

725
00:50:28,247 --> 00:50:29,874
Why should you build such a thing?

726
00:50:29,957 --> 00:50:32,626
There were those of us
who fought against it, but in the end,

727
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,379
we could not keep up with the expense
involved in the arms race,

728
00:50:35,463 --> 00:50:38,966
the space race and the peace race.

729
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:44,221
And at the same time, our people grumbled
for more nylons and washing machines.

730
00:50:44,305 --> 00:50:47,641
Our doomsday scheme cost us just a small
fraction of what we'd been spending

731
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:50,061
on defense in a single year.

732
00:50:50,144 --> 00:50:52,813
But the deciding factor
was when we learned that your country

733
00:50:52,897 --> 00:50:54,690
was working along similar lines

734
00:50:54,774 --> 00:50:56,859
and we were afraid
of a doomsday gap.

735
00:50:56,942 --> 00:51:00,154
This is preposterous.
I've never approved of anything like that.

736
00:51:00,237 --> 00:51:03,115
Our source was The New York Times.

737
00:51:03,866 --> 00:51:07,078
Dr. Strangelove, do we have
anything like that in the works?

738
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:09,371
A moment, please, Mr. President.

739
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:15,628
Under the authority granted me

740
00:51:15,711 --> 00:51:19,840
as director of weapons research
and development,

741
00:51:19,924 --> 00:51:24,136
I commissioned last year
a study of this project

742
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,597
by the Bland Corporation.

743
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,725
Based on the findings of the report,

744
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:35,231
my conclusion was that this idea
was not a practical deterrent

745
00:51:35,314 --> 00:51:39,276
for reasons which, at this moment,
must be all too obvious.

746
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,780
Then you mean it is possible
for them to have built such a thing?

747
00:51:46,784 --> 00:51:49,829
Mr. President,
the technology required

748
00:51:49,912 --> 00:51:56,168
is easily within the means
of even the smallest nuclear power.

749
00:51:56,252 --> 00:52:00,422
It requires only the will to do so.

750
00:52:01,298 --> 00:52:05,052
But how is it possible for this thing
to be triggered automatically

751
00:52:05,136 --> 00:52:07,555
and at the same time,
impossible to untrigger?

752
00:52:07,638 --> 00:52:11,809
Mr. President,
it is not only possible,

753
00:52:11,892 --> 00:52:13,519
it is essential.

754
00:52:13,602 --> 00:52:18,065
That is the whole idea
of this machine, you know.

755
00:52:18,149 --> 00:52:23,362
Deterrence is the art of producing
in the mind of the enemy

756
00:52:23,445 --> 00:52:26,157
the fear to attack.

757
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,036
And so, because of the automated
and irrevocable decision-making process

758
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,999
which rules out human meddling,

759
00:52:35,082 --> 00:52:39,044
the Doomsday Machine is terrifying.

760
00:52:39,128 --> 00:52:41,338
Yes, and simple to understand.

761
00:52:41,422 --> 00:52:44,884
And completely credible and convincing.

762
00:52:44,967 --> 00:52:47,970
I wish we had one of them
Doomsday Machines, Stainsey.

763
00:52:48,053 --> 00:52:50,139
But this is fantastic, Strangelove.

764
00:52:50,222 --> 00:52:52,183
How can it be triggered automatically?

765
00:52:52,266 --> 00:52:55,895
Well, it's remarkably simple to do that.

766
00:52:55,978 --> 00:52:59,481
When you merely wish to bury bombs,

767
00:52:59,565 --> 00:53:01,984
there's no limit to the size.

768
00:53:02,067 --> 00:53:04,278
After that, they are connected

769
00:53:04,361 --> 00:53:08,324
to a gigantic complex of computers.

770
00:53:08,407 --> 00:53:14,246
Now then, a specific and clearly defined
set of circumstances

771
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:17,708
under which the bombs
are to be exploded

772
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:21,879
is programmed
into a tape memory bank.

773
00:53:21,962 --> 00:53:24,506
- Strangelove.
- A single roll of tape

774
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:27,468
- can store all the information...
- What kind of a name is that?

775
00:53:27,551 --> 00:53:29,261
That ain't no Kraut name,
is it, Stainsey?

776
00:53:29,345 --> 00:53:31,555
He changed it
when he became a citizen.

777
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:33,599
It used to be Merkwurdichliebe.

778
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,104
Well, a Kraut by any other name,
Stainsey?

779
00:53:40,898 --> 00:53:45,236
...is that the whole point
of the Doomsday Machine

780
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:48,697
is lost if you keep it a secret.

781
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:51,242
Why didn't you tell the world, eh?

782
00:53:51,325 --> 00:53:55,704
It was to be announced
at the Party Congress on Monday.

783
00:53:55,788 --> 00:53:59,083
As you know,
the premier loves surprises.

784
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:49,591
Stay with me, Mandrake.

785
00:54:54,722 --> 00:54:57,558
All right, Mandrake.
Now feed me, feed me, boy.

786
00:55:27,588 --> 00:55:30,388
Jack, don't you think we'd be better off
in some other part of the room

787
00:55:30,466 --> 00:55:32,384
away from all this flying glass?

788
00:55:32,468 --> 00:55:34,303
We're okay here.

789
00:55:36,305 --> 00:55:38,015
Mandrake.

790
00:55:38,098 --> 00:55:40,351
Do you realize that in addition
to fluoridating water, why,

791
00:55:40,434 --> 00:55:45,230
there are studies under way
to fluoridate salt, flour, fruit juices,

792
00:55:45,314 --> 00:55:49,151
soup, sugar, milk, ice cream?

793
00:55:49,234 --> 00:55:51,779
Ice cream, Mandrake.
Children's ice cream.

794
00:55:51,862 --> 00:55:53,030
Good Lord.

795
00:55:53,113 --> 00:55:55,157
Do you know
when fluoridation first began?

796
00:55:56,617 --> 00:55:58,452
No, no, I don't, Jack.

797
00:55:58,535 --> 00:56:00,954
1946.

798
00:56:01,038 --> 00:56:04,124
1946, Mandrake.

799
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:07,252
How does that coincide with
your postwar commie conspiracy, huh?

800
00:56:08,295 --> 00:56:11,298
It's incredibly obvious, isn't it?

801
00:56:11,382 --> 00:56:17,096
A foreign substance is introduced
into our precious bodily fluids

802
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:20,432
without the knowledge of the individual

803
00:56:20,516 --> 00:56:22,851
and certainly without any choice.

804
00:56:24,186 --> 00:56:26,772
That's the way
your hard-core commie works.

805
00:56:28,857 --> 00:56:31,443
Jack, Jack, listen. Tell me.

806
00:56:31,527 --> 00:56:34,947
Tell me, Jack, when did you
first become...

807
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:37,908
well, develop this theory?

808
00:56:38,992 --> 00:56:41,036
Well, I...

809
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,748
I first became aware of it, Mandrake,

810
00:56:44,832 --> 00:56:47,084
during the physical act of love.

811
00:56:48,752 --> 00:56:54,675
Yes, a profound sense of fatigue,
a feeling of emptiness followed.

812
00:56:55,676 --> 00:56:59,346
Luckily, I was able to interpret
these feelings correctly.

813
00:57:00,848 --> 00:57:02,474
Loss of essence.

814
00:57:02,558 --> 00:57:04,017
Yeah.

815
00:57:04,101 --> 00:57:07,020
I can assure you
it has not recurred, Mandrake.

816
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,733
Women sense my power

817
00:57:11,817 --> 00:57:13,944
and they seek the life essence.

818
00:57:15,404 --> 00:57:18,824
- I do not avoid women, Mandrake.
- No.

819
00:57:18,907 --> 00:57:21,785
But I do deny them my essence.

820
00:57:21,869 --> 00:57:24,705
Yes, Jack.

821
00:57:37,384 --> 00:57:39,761
Cease fire!

822
00:58:00,616 --> 00:58:02,618
The boys must have surrendered.

823
00:58:02,701 --> 00:58:04,912
Well, there it is.

824
00:58:04,995 --> 00:58:06,747
Now, Jack, listen,

825
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:10,000
while there's still time, I beg you,
let's recall the wing and...

826
00:58:12,211 --> 00:58:14,630
Those boys were like my children,
Mandrake.

827
00:58:16,632 --> 00:58:18,217
Now they've let me down.

828
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,135
No, no, Jack, not a bit of it.

829
00:58:20,219 --> 00:58:23,347
No, I'm sure they all gave
of their very best.

830
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:25,933
And I'm equally sure they all died
thinking of you...

831
00:58:26,016 --> 00:58:28,852
every man Jack of them... Jack.

832
00:58:28,936 --> 00:58:31,313
Supposing a bit of water has gone off?

833
00:58:31,396 --> 00:58:34,107
Certainly one can never be too sure
about those sort of things.

834
00:58:34,191 --> 00:58:37,069
But you look at me now.
Do I look all rancid and clotted?

835
00:58:37,152 --> 00:58:39,613
You look at me, Jack, eh?
Look, eh?

836
00:58:39,696 --> 00:58:43,283
I drink a lot of water, you know.
I'm what you might call a water man, Jack.

837
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:44,368
That's what I am.

838
00:58:44,451 --> 00:58:47,371
And I can swear to you, my boy,
swear to you,

839
00:58:47,454 --> 00:58:49,706
that there's nothing wrong
with my bodily fluids.

840
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:52,334
Not a thing, Jackie.

841
00:58:52,417 --> 00:58:54,711
Mandrake, were you ever
a prisoner of war?

842
00:58:54,795 --> 00:58:58,382
Well, Jack, the time's running very...

843
00:58:58,465 --> 00:59:01,260
- What?
- Were you ever a prisoner of war?

844
00:59:01,343 --> 00:59:03,971
Yes, I was,
as a matter of fact, Jack, I was.

845
00:59:04,054 --> 00:59:07,432
- Did they torture you?
- Yes, they did.

846
00:59:07,516 --> 00:59:10,227
I was tortured by the Japanese,
Jack, if you must know.

847
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,896
- Not a pretty story.
- Well, what happened?

848
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,065
Oh, well, I don't know, Jack.

849
00:59:15,148 --> 00:59:17,693
It's difficult to think of
under these conditions,

850
00:59:17,776 --> 00:59:20,904
but, well, what happened
was they got me on the old

851
00:59:20,988 --> 00:59:23,448
Rangoon-Ichinawa Railway.

852
00:59:23,532 --> 00:59:27,869
I was laying train lines
for the bloody Japanese puff-puffs.

853
00:59:27,953 --> 00:59:31,206
No, I mean,
when they tortured you, did you talk?

854
00:59:33,041 --> 00:59:36,837
No, I... Well, I don't think
they wanted me to talk, really.

855
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,298
I don't think they wanted me
to say anything.

856
00:59:39,381 --> 00:59:42,426
It was just their way of having
a bit of fun, the swines.

857
00:59:42,509 --> 00:59:46,013
The strange thing is
they make such bloody good cameras.

858
00:59:47,681 --> 00:59:50,934
You know, those clowns outside are
gonna give me a pretty good going over

859
00:59:51,018 --> 00:59:53,520
in a few minutes, for the code.

860
00:59:53,604 --> 00:59:55,105
Yes...

861
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,943
Yes, well, you may have...
You may have quite a point there, Jack.

862
01:00:01,028 --> 01:00:03,739
I don't know how well
I could stand up under torture.

863
01:00:03,822 --> 01:00:07,242
Well, of course, the answer to that
is, boy, no one ever does.

864
01:00:07,326 --> 01:00:11,455
And my advice to you, Jack,
is to give me the code now,

865
01:00:11,538 --> 01:00:14,333
and if those devils come back
and try any rough stuff,

866
01:00:14,416 --> 01:00:17,836
we'll fight 'em together, boy,
like we did just now on the floor, eh?

867
01:00:17,919 --> 01:00:21,465
You with your gun, and me with the belt
and the ammo, feeding you, Jack.

868
01:00:21,548 --> 01:00:24,301
"Feed me", you said,
and I was feeding you, Jack.

869
01:00:24,384 --> 01:00:26,970
You know, Mandrake,

870
01:00:27,054 --> 01:00:30,057
I happen to believe
in a life after this one,

871
01:00:31,808 --> 01:00:34,519
and I know I'll have to answer
for what I've done.

872
01:00:37,022 --> 01:00:38,482
And I think I can.

873
01:00:38,565 --> 01:00:41,902
Yes, well, of course you can, Jack.
Of course you can. You can.

874
01:00:41,985 --> 01:00:44,154
I'm a religious man myself,
you know, Jack.

875
01:00:44,237 --> 01:00:47,824
I believe in all that sort of thing,
and I'm hoping you know, Jack.

876
01:00:47,908 --> 01:00:49,868
You've dropped your gun, Jack.

877
01:00:49,951 --> 01:00:53,080
Yes, you know what...
Here. No, Jack, let me take that for you.

878
01:00:53,163 --> 01:00:56,041
I'll take that for you, Jack.
And you know what I'm hoping, Jack?

879
01:00:56,124 --> 01:00:59,169
I'm hoping you're going to give me
the code, boy, that's what I'm hoping.

880
01:00:59,252 --> 01:01:02,964
You're going to have a little wash
and brush up, are you? What a good idea.

881
01:01:03,048 --> 01:01:06,051
Always did wonders for a man that, Jack.
A little wash and brush up.

882
01:01:06,134 --> 01:01:08,512
Water on the back of the neck.
Makes you feel marvelous.

883
01:01:08,595 --> 01:01:11,848
That's what we need, Jack.
Water on the back of the neck and the code.

884
01:01:11,932 --> 01:01:14,184
Supposing I play a little guessing game
with you, Jack boy.

885
01:01:14,267 --> 01:01:16,853
I'll try and guess,
I'll try and guess what the code is.

886
01:01:34,496 --> 01:01:38,917
Copilot to Navigator.
I'm ready with the fuel figures now.

887
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,045
We have 109,000 total,

888
01:01:42,129 --> 01:01:44,881
79,000 in the mains

889
01:01:44,965 --> 01:01:47,676
and 30,000 in the auxiliaries.

890
01:01:47,759 --> 01:01:51,012
And that works out to roughly
seven hours, 15 minutes

891
01:01:51,096 --> 01:01:53,390
endurance for this time.

892
01:01:55,016 --> 01:01:58,520
DSO to Captain.
I have an unidentified radar blip.

893
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,733
Distance, 60 miles.

894
01:02:04,317 --> 01:02:07,279
Approximate speed, Mach 3.

895
01:02:07,362 --> 01:02:09,781
Looks like a missile tracking us.

896
01:02:11,867 --> 01:02:13,952
Confirmed. Definite missile track.

897
01:02:14,035 --> 01:02:16,621
Commence evasive action right.

898
01:02:22,836 --> 01:02:25,380
Missile still closing range.

899
01:02:26,506 --> 01:02:30,594
Distance, 50 miles.
Continue evasive action.

900
01:02:30,677 --> 01:02:32,846
Lock ECM to target intercept mode.

901
01:02:32,929 --> 01:02:36,183
ECM locked to target intercept mode.

902
01:02:37,184 --> 01:02:39,561
Missile still tracking
and closing distance.

903
01:02:39,644 --> 01:02:41,396
Range, 40 miles.

904
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,690
Continue evasive action.

905
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:50,864
Electronic guidance scrambler
to blue grid.

906
01:02:50,947 --> 01:02:54,451
Missile still tracking steady
and closing distance.

907
01:02:54,534 --> 01:02:56,369
Range, 30 miles.

908
01:02:58,538 --> 01:03:01,041
Missile still closing, true and steady.

909
01:03:01,124 --> 01:03:02,876
Continue evasive action.

910
01:03:10,425 --> 01:03:12,469
Range, 20 miles.

911
01:03:12,552 --> 01:03:16,348
Missile still closing distance
and tracking steady.

912
01:03:16,431 --> 01:03:18,850
Attack range gate on maximum scan.

913
01:03:18,934 --> 01:03:21,394
Range gate on maximum scan.

914
01:03:22,062 --> 01:03:24,356
Range, 10 miles.

915
01:03:24,439 --> 01:03:27,984
Missile track deflecting.
Continue evasive action.

916
01:03:28,068 --> 01:03:31,530
Deflection increasing.
Range, eight miles.

917
01:03:31,613 --> 01:03:35,659
Deflection still increasing.
Range, six miles.

918
01:03:35,742 --> 01:03:38,495
Missile still deflecting.
Range, four miles.

919
01:03:44,751 --> 01:03:47,504
Range, two miles.
Missile still deflecting.

920
01:03:47,587 --> 01:03:49,506
Range, one mile.
Missile detonated.

921
01:03:56,471 --> 01:03:58,598
- Start lever to cut off.
- Cut off.

922
01:04:01,977 --> 01:04:04,938
- Lost engine power.
- Lost power. Got it.

923
01:04:11,862 --> 01:04:14,281
Reselect essential power.

924
01:04:14,364 --> 01:04:16,645
- Oh, shoot. There goes six.
- Essential power reselected.

925
01:04:23,748 --> 01:04:25,876
The hatch is stuck.

926
01:04:28,128 --> 01:04:30,463
- Hit emergency power.
- Okay.

927
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:35,218
- Extinguishers.
- Roger.

928
01:04:41,975 --> 01:04:44,019
Transfer switches.

929
01:04:44,102 --> 01:04:46,479
- Transferred.
- Push pumps up.

930
01:04:46,563 --> 01:04:47,564
Cut off.

931
01:04:59,326 --> 01:05:01,328
Fuel valves three, four and six.

932
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,468
- Give me full power.
- Roger.

933
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:30,607
Peace on earth.

934
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:32,901
Peace on earth.

935
01:05:32,984 --> 01:05:35,236
Peace on earth.

936
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,821
POE.

937
01:05:38,031 --> 01:05:41,034
Purity of essence.

938
01:05:41,117 --> 01:05:44,788
POE.

939
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:46,873
OPE.

940
01:05:55,757 --> 01:05:57,467
Put your hands over your head.

941
01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:00,804
What the devil do you think you're doing,
shooting your way in here? Who are you?

942
01:06:00,887 --> 01:06:02,722
I said, put your hands over your head.

943
01:06:03,765 --> 01:06:06,267
What kind of suit
do you call that, fella?

944
01:06:06,351 --> 01:06:08,311
What do you mean, suit?

945
01:06:08,395 --> 01:06:13,316
This happens to be an RAF uniform, sir,
and I am Group Captain Lionel Mandrake.

946
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,318
I am General Ripper's
executive officer.

947
01:06:15,402 --> 01:06:16,903
Where's General Ripper?

948
01:06:16,987 --> 01:06:19,864
He's dead, in the bathroom.

949
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:23,410
- Where's the bathroom?
- Next to you.

950
01:06:32,961 --> 01:06:35,755
Look, I don't know what sort
of stupid game this is you're playing,

951
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:38,008
but I've got a very good idea
what the recall code is

952
01:06:38,091 --> 01:06:40,593
and I have to get in touch
with SAC headquarters immediately.

953
01:06:40,677 --> 01:06:44,222
I said put your hands over your head
and keep them there. Come on.

954
01:06:44,305 --> 01:06:46,141
- Got any witnesses?
- Witnesses?

955
01:06:46,224 --> 01:06:48,184
What are you talking about, witnesses?
He shot himself.

956
01:06:48,268 --> 01:06:50,270
While he was shaving?

957
01:06:51,062 --> 01:06:55,900
Now look, Colonel Bat Guano,
if that really is your name,

958
01:06:55,984 --> 01:06:59,821
may I tell you
that I have a very, very good idea,

959
01:06:59,904 --> 01:07:03,074
I think, I hope, I pray,
what the recall code is.

960
01:07:03,158 --> 01:07:05,035
It's some sort of recurrent theme
he kept repeating.

961
01:07:05,118 --> 01:07:07,412
It's a variation on "peace on earth"
or "purity of essence".

962
01:07:07,495 --> 01:07:11,499
- EOP, OPE. It's one of those.
- Put your hands up on top of your head.

963
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:13,043
Start walkin'.

964
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:16,463
Don't you know that General Ripper
went as mad as a bloody March hare

965
01:07:16,546 --> 01:07:19,841
and sent the whole wing
to attack the Soviets?

966
01:07:19,924 --> 01:07:23,386
- What are you talking about?
- I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

967
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:27,515
I'm going to pick up this red telephone,
which is connected to SAC,

968
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,351
and I hope...

969
01:07:30,435 --> 01:07:32,771
Blast. Blast.

970
01:07:32,854 --> 01:07:36,858
Shot away, I expect, by one of your men
during this ridiculous fighting.

971
01:07:38,193 --> 01:07:40,403
Right.

972
01:07:40,487 --> 01:07:43,782
All right, Charlie, I've been
wasting too much time on you.

973
01:07:43,865 --> 01:07:46,117
I've got a lot of wounded men outside.

974
01:07:46,201 --> 01:07:47,744
Start walking.

975
01:08:09,849 --> 01:08:13,853
All the radio gear is out,
including the CRM 114.

976
01:08:13,937 --> 01:08:17,107
I think the auto-destruct mechanism
got hit and blew itself up.

977
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:24,781
The fire is out.
Emergency power is on.

978
01:08:24,864 --> 01:08:28,368
Everything seems to check out all right.
Will advise.

979
01:08:28,451 --> 01:08:30,161
Roger. Navigator.

980
01:08:30,245 --> 01:08:35,625
I've worked out our rate of fuel loss
at approximately 162 per minute.

981
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:38,503
This gives us a radius of action
sufficient to take out

982
01:08:38,586 --> 01:08:40,797
primary and secondary targets,

983
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,509
but we will not - repeat -
not be able to make it back

984
01:08:44,592 --> 01:08:46,302
to any base or neutral country.

985
01:08:47,262 --> 01:08:52,100
However, we would have enough fuel
to ditch at weather ship Tango Delta,

986
01:08:52,183 --> 01:08:55,895
grid coordinates 003691.

987
01:09:00,733 --> 01:09:02,986
Well, boys, we got three engines out,

988
01:09:03,069 --> 01:09:06,865
we got more holes in us
than a horse trader's mule,

989
01:09:06,948 --> 01:09:09,159
the radio is gone
and we're leaking fuel,

990
01:09:09,242 --> 01:09:12,579
and if we was flying any lower,
why, we'd need sleigh bells on this thing.

991
01:09:12,662 --> 01:09:15,623
But we got one little budge
on them Russkies.

992
01:09:15,707 --> 01:09:17,667
At this height,
why, they might harpoon us,

993
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:20,879
but they dang sure ain't gonna
spot us on no radar screen.

994
01:09:32,015 --> 01:09:33,892
The other way.

995
01:09:33,975 --> 01:09:36,853
- Where are you taking me?
- The main gate.

996
01:09:36,936 --> 01:09:38,479
Colonel!

997
01:09:38,563 --> 01:09:42,025
Colonel, I must know what you think
has been going on here.

998
01:09:42,108 --> 01:09:43,902
- You want to know what I think?
- Yes.

999
01:09:43,985 --> 01:09:46,779
I think you're some kind
of deviated "prevert".

1000
01:09:46,863 --> 01:09:49,365
And I think General Ripper
found out about your "preversion",

1001
01:09:49,449 --> 01:09:52,118
and that you were organizing
some kind of mutiny of "preverts".

1002
01:09:52,202 --> 01:09:54,204
Now move.

1003
01:09:54,287 --> 01:09:57,415
On top of that, I don't know anything
about any planes attacking Russia.

1004
01:09:57,498 --> 01:10:01,586
I was told to get General Ripper on the phone
with the president of the United States.

1005
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:06,549
Now, just one second.
You just said "the president".

1006
01:10:06,633 --> 01:10:08,718
What about the president?

1007
01:10:08,801 --> 01:10:11,971
Now, the president wants to speak
to General Ripper, doesn't he?

1008
01:10:12,055 --> 01:10:14,641
Now, General Ripper is dead,
is he not?

1009
01:10:14,724 --> 01:10:16,851
I am General Ripper's executive officer,

1010
01:10:16,935 --> 01:10:20,063
so the president will bloody well
want to speak to me, won't he?

1011
01:10:20,146 --> 01:10:23,733
There's a telephone box over there
and the line may be open.

1012
01:10:23,816 --> 01:10:26,527
You want to talk to the president
of the United States?

1013
01:10:26,611 --> 01:10:29,489
I don't want to talk to him, Colonel.
I've got to talk to him.

1014
01:10:29,572 --> 01:10:33,409
And I can assure you, if you don't put that
gun away and stop this stupid nonsense,

1015
01:10:33,493 --> 01:10:37,747
the Court of Inquiry on this'll
give you such a pranging,

1016
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:41,626
you'll be lucky if you end up wearing
the uniform of a bloody toilet attendant!

1017
01:10:45,505 --> 01:10:47,340
Okay. Go ahead.

1018
01:10:47,423 --> 01:10:50,718
Try and get the president
of the United States on the phone.

1019
01:10:52,929 --> 01:10:56,182
If you try any "preversions" in there,
I'll blow your head off.

1020
01:11:09,529 --> 01:11:12,240
Operator?
This is Group Captain Lionel Mandrake.

1021
01:11:12,323 --> 01:11:14,450
I'm speaking
from Burpelson Air Force Base.

1022
01:11:14,534 --> 01:11:16,202
Look, something very urgent has come up

1023
01:11:16,286 --> 01:11:18,371
and I want you to place
an emergency person-to-person call

1024
01:11:18,454 --> 01:11:21,541
with President Merkin Muffley
in the Pentagon, Washington, DC.

1025
01:11:22,834 --> 01:11:26,170
Burpelson 39180.

1026
01:11:27,547 --> 01:11:29,716
No. I'm perfectly serious, Operator.
The president.

1027
01:11:29,799 --> 01:11:32,302
Yes, the president
of the United States.

1028
01:11:32,385 --> 01:11:34,512
Oh. I'm sorry.
I haven't got enough change.

1029
01:11:34,595 --> 01:11:36,472
Could you...

1030
01:11:36,556 --> 01:11:38,891
Could you make this
a collect call, Operator?

1031
01:11:51,154 --> 01:11:53,406
Just one second, Operator.

1032
01:11:53,489 --> 01:11:55,992
They won't accept the call.
Have you got 55 cents?

1033
01:11:56,075 --> 01:11:59,537
Well, you don't think I'd go into combat
with loose change in my pocket, do you?

1034
01:12:01,873 --> 01:12:03,374
Operator?

1035
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:05,001
Look...

1036
01:12:05,084 --> 01:12:08,254
is it possible to make this
an ordinary trunk call?

1037
01:12:08,338 --> 01:12:13,676
Well, what do you call it?
You know... Oh, station to station.

1038
01:12:18,348 --> 01:12:21,351
Oh, blast! I'm still 20 cents short.

1039
01:12:23,644 --> 01:12:27,023
Operator, hold on.
I shan't keep you a second.

1040
01:12:27,106 --> 01:12:29,692
Colonel, that Coca-Cola machine.

1041
01:12:29,776 --> 01:12:33,613
I want you to shoot the lock off it.
There may be some change in there.

1042
01:12:37,033 --> 01:12:38,534
That's private property.

1043
01:12:38,618 --> 01:12:41,537
Colonel, can you possibly imagine
what is going to happen to you,

1044
01:12:41,621 --> 01:12:44,248
your frame, outlook,
way of life and everything,

1045
01:12:44,332 --> 01:12:47,085
when they've learned that you
have obstructed a telephone call

1046
01:12:47,168 --> 01:12:48,920
to the president of the United States?

1047
01:12:49,003 --> 01:12:51,172
Can you imagine?

1048
01:12:51,255 --> 01:12:53,925
Shoot it off! Shoot with a gun.

1049
01:12:54,008 --> 01:12:56,677
That's what the bullets are for, you twit!

1050
01:12:56,761 --> 01:12:58,262
Okay.

1051
01:12:58,346 --> 01:13:00,056
I'm gonna get your money for you.

1052
01:13:00,139 --> 01:13:03,059
But if you don't get the president
of the United States on that phone,

1053
01:13:03,142 --> 01:13:04,977
- you know what's going to happen to you?
- What?

1054
01:13:05,061 --> 01:13:08,314
You're gonna have to answer
to the Coca-Cola company.

1055
01:13:17,407 --> 01:13:20,243
<i>This is SAC Communications Control.</i>

1056
01:13:20,326 --> 01:13:23,830
<i>The recall code OPE</i>

1057

1064
01:13:48,688 --> 01:13:51,482
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

1065
01:13:51,566 --> 01:13:53,901
Gentlemen.

1066
01:13:53,985 --> 01:13:55,945
Mr. President.

1067
01:13:56,028 --> 01:13:58,281
I'm not a sentimentalist
at all by nature,

1068
01:13:58,364 --> 01:14:01,492
but I think I know
what's in every heart in this room.

1069
01:14:01,576 --> 01:14:04,704
I think we ought to
all just bow our heads

1070
01:14:04,787 --> 01:14:07,415
and give a short prayer of thanks
for our deliverance.

1071
01:14:07,498 --> 01:14:10,209
Lord!

1072
01:14:10,293 --> 01:14:14,839
We have heard the wings
of the angel of death

1073
01:14:14,922 --> 01:14:17,675
fluttering over our heads
from the valley of fear.

1074
01:14:17,758 --> 01:14:20,553
You have seen fit to deliver us
from the forces of evil.

1075
01:14:20,636 --> 01:14:22,305
Excuse me, sir.

1076
01:14:22,388 --> 01:14:25,475
Premier Kissoff's calling again,
and he's hopping mad.

1077
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:36,027
Fuel flow on active engines
and leakage has increased.

1078
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:39,989
Now works out at 205.

1079
01:14:41,532 --> 01:14:47,914
Estimate remaining fuel at 8790.

1080
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:54,462
Roger, confirm 205 per minute

1081
01:14:54,545 --> 01:14:58,591
and remaining fuel 8790.

1082
01:15:05,097 --> 01:15:09,143
No. No, Dmitri,
there must be some mistake.

1083
01:15:09,227 --> 01:15:11,270
No, I'm certain of that.

1084
01:15:11,354 --> 01:15:13,773
I'm perfectly certain of that, Dmitri.

1085
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:17,485
Just a second.

1086
01:15:17,568 --> 01:15:20,905
You know what he says? He says that
one of the planes hasn't turned back.

1087
01:15:20,988 --> 01:15:23,699
He says, according to information
forwarded by our air staffs,

1088
01:15:23,783 --> 01:15:26,452
it's headed for the missile complex
at Laputa.

1089
01:15:30,706 --> 01:15:32,708
That's impossible, Mr. President.

1090
01:15:32,792 --> 01:15:34,710
I mean, look at the big board.

1091
01:15:34,794 --> 01:15:38,214
Thirty-four planes. 30 recalls
acknowledged and four splashes,

1092
01:15:38,297 --> 01:15:40,800
and one of them
was targeted for Laputa.

1093
01:15:43,761 --> 01:15:46,889
Dmitri? Look, we've got
an acknowledgement from every plane

1094
01:15:46,973 --> 01:15:49,141
except the four you shot down.

1095
01:15:57,108 --> 01:15:59,860
He... Hang on a second, Dmitri.

1096
01:15:59,944 --> 01:16:03,322
He says their air defense now
only claims three aircraft confirmed.

1097
01:16:03,406 --> 01:16:05,491
The fourth may only be damaged.

1098
01:16:07,994 --> 01:16:12,748
Mr. President, I'm beginning
to smell a big fat commie rat.

1099
01:16:12,832 --> 01:16:16,627
I mean, supposing Kissoff
is lying about that fourth plane,

1100
01:16:16,711 --> 01:16:18,629
just looking for an excuse
to clobber us?

1101
01:16:18,713 --> 01:16:22,258
I mean, if the spaghetti hits the fan,
now we're really in trouble.

1102
01:16:25,595 --> 01:16:31,517
Dmitri? Look, if this report is true
and the plane manages to bomb the target,

1103
01:16:31,601 --> 01:16:33,603
is this... is this going to

1104
01:16:33,686 --> 01:16:35,938
is this going to set off
the Doomsday Machine?

1105
01:16:39,025 --> 01:16:40,943
Are you sure?

1106
01:16:42,486 --> 01:16:46,866
Well, I guess you're just going
to have to get that plane, Dmitri.

1107
01:16:46,949 --> 01:16:50,119
Dmitri, I'm sorry they're jamming
your radar and flying so low,

1108
01:16:50,202 --> 01:16:51,746
but they're trained to do it.

1109
01:16:51,829 --> 01:16:53,539
It's initiative.

1110
01:16:55,625 --> 01:16:58,794
Look, Dmitri, you know
exactly where they're going,

1111
01:16:58,878 --> 01:17:02,882
and I'm sure your entire air defense
can stop a single plane.

1112
01:17:04,258 --> 01:17:07,178
Listen, I mean, it's not gonna
help either one of us

1113
01:17:07,261 --> 01:17:10,931
if the Doomsday Machine goes off,
now, is it?

1114
01:17:11,015 --> 01:17:16,479
Dmitri, there's no point in you
getting hysterical at a moment like this.

1115
01:17:16,562 --> 01:17:20,983
Dmitri, keep your feet on the ground
when you're talking, Dmitri.

1116
01:17:21,067 --> 01:17:23,152
I am not... I am not getting...

1117
01:17:23,235 --> 01:17:27,323
No, Dmitri, I'm just worried, that's all.

1118
01:17:27,406 --> 01:17:30,701
Now look, if our air staff say
its primary target is Laputa

1119
01:17:30,785 --> 01:17:32,828
and its secondary target is Barchov,

1120
01:17:32,912 --> 01:17:36,165
I mean, it's true, Dmitri,
you've got to believe it.

1121
01:17:36,248 --> 01:17:39,960
Look, can I give... Dmitri?
Can I give you just one word...

1122
01:17:40,044 --> 01:17:43,255
Can I give you just one word
of advice, Dmitri?

1123
01:17:43,339 --> 01:17:48,761
Listen, Dmitri, put everything you've got
into those two sectors and you can't miss.

1124
01:17:55,142 --> 01:17:58,813
Sir, if we continue
to lose fuel at the present rate,

1125
01:17:58,896 --> 01:18:02,817
I estimate we only have,
38 minutes flying time,

1126
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:05,569
which will not even take us
as far as the primary.

1127
01:18:06,278 --> 01:18:09,532
Doggone it, Sweets, you told me
that you'd get me to the primary!

1128
01:18:09,615 --> 01:18:13,536
I'm sorry, sir. That estimate was based
on the original loss rate factor,

1129
01:18:13,619 --> 01:18:15,371
not at 205.

1130
01:18:15,454 --> 01:18:19,917
I don't give a hoot in hell how you do it.
You just get me to the primary, you hear?

1131
01:18:20,835 --> 01:18:23,754
I'm sorry, sir, but those are the figures.

1132
01:18:23,838 --> 01:18:26,716
We'll be lucky to reach
weather ship at Tango Delta.

1133
01:18:26,799 --> 01:18:28,968
Well, shoot!

1134
01:18:29,051 --> 01:18:32,304
We ain't come this far
just to dump this thing in the drink.

1135
01:18:33,472 --> 01:18:35,474
What's the nearest target of opportunity?

1136
01:18:44,316 --> 01:18:46,902
Sir, if the rate of loss does not increase,

1137
01:18:46,986 --> 01:18:50,906
we have a chance to reach target 384,

1138
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:55,619
grid coordinate 003691

1139
01:18:55,703 --> 01:18:59,665
and possibly make it from there
to the Tango Delta weather ship.

1140
01:18:59,749 --> 01:19:01,917
What kind of a target is that anyhow?

1141
01:19:02,001 --> 01:19:05,921
Sir, that's the ICBM complex at Kotlas.

1142
01:19:06,005 --> 01:19:07,590
All right.

1143
01:19:07,673 --> 01:19:10,718
Designating new target 384.

1144
01:19:10,801 --> 01:19:14,805
Give me a rough heading on that just as soon
as you can get it worked out, will ya?

1145
01:19:26,859 --> 01:19:28,778
Well, we'll keep our fingers crossed,
Dmitri,

1146
01:19:28,861 --> 01:19:31,739
and remember, there's just one thing,
we are all in this together.

1147
01:19:31,822 --> 01:19:35,576
We're right behind you, Dmitri.
We're with you all the way.

1148
01:19:35,659 --> 01:19:38,287
Yes, well, we'll keep the line open.

1149
01:19:39,455 --> 01:19:41,373
All right, Dmitri.

1150
01:19:43,876 --> 01:19:47,755
General Turgidson, is there really
a chance for that plane to get through?

1151
01:19:49,757 --> 01:19:52,218
Mr. President, if I may speak freely,

1152
01:19:52,301 --> 01:19:55,888
the Russki talks big, but frankly,
we think he's short of know-how.

1153
01:19:55,971 --> 01:19:59,016
You just can't expect
a bunch of ignorant peons

1154
01:19:59,099 --> 01:20:01,101
to understand a machine
like some of our boys.

1155
01:20:01,185 --> 01:20:03,020
That's not meant as an insult,
Mr. Ambassador.

1156
01:20:03,103 --> 01:20:05,856
You take your average Russki,
we all know how much guts he's got.

1157
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:08,901
Hell, look at all them Nazis killed off,
and he still wouldn't quit.

1158
01:20:08,984 --> 01:20:10,861
Can't you stick to the point, General?

1159
01:20:10,945 --> 01:20:13,322
Well sir,

1160
01:20:13,405 --> 01:20:16,826
if the pilot's good, see,
I mean, if he's really sharp,

1161
01:20:16,909 --> 01:20:19,119
he can barrel that baby in so low.

1162
01:20:19,203 --> 01:20:21,413
You ought to
see it sometime. It's a sight.

1163
01:20:21,497 --> 01:20:23,457
A big plane like a 52. Vroom!

1164
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:26,669
Its jet exhaust frying chickens
in a barnyard.

1165
01:20:26,752 --> 01:20:29,713
- Yeah, but has he got a chance?
- Has he got a chance?

1166
01:20:29,797 --> 01:20:32,258
Hell, yeah... he's...

1167
01:20:33,759 --> 01:20:35,302
got a...

1168
01:20:56,866 --> 01:20:58,367

1169
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:02,788

Pulse indent transponder active.

1229
01:25:55,831 --> 01:25:57,541
Pulse indent transponder active.

1230
01:26:04,590 --> 01:26:07,676
Target distance, five miles.

1231
01:26:07,759 --> 01:26:11,680
Five miles.
Homing alignment factor to zero mode.

1232
01:26:11,763 --> 01:26:13,765
Homing alignment factor to zero mode.

1233
01:26:17,352 --> 01:26:19,897
Target distance, four miles.

1234
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:24,610
Roger. Four miles.
Auto CDC into manual Teleflex link.

1235
01:26:24,693 --> 01:26:27,362
Auto CDC into manual Teleflex link.

1236
01:26:37,539 --> 01:26:40,083
Target distance, three miles.

1237
01:26:40,167 --> 01:26:42,544
Roger. Three miles.

1238
01:26:42,628 --> 01:26:44,296
Target in sight!

1239
01:26:44,379 --> 01:26:46,381
Where in hell is Major Kong?

1240
01:27:10,155 --> 01:27:11,406
Hey, what about Major Kong?

1241
01:27:39,768 --> 01:27:41,270
Mr. President.

1242
01:27:41,353 --> 01:27:46,441
I would not rule out the chance to preserve
a nucleus of human specimens.

1243
01:27:46,525 --> 01:27:49,444
It would be quite easy.

1244
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:56,952
At the bottom of some
of our deeper mine shafts.

1245
01:27:57,035 --> 01:28:01,623
The radioactivity would never penetrate
a mine some thousands of feet deep.

1246
01:28:01,707 --> 01:28:06,169
And in a matter of weeks,
sufficient improvements in dwelling space

1247
01:28:06,253 --> 01:28:08,297
could easily be provided.

1248
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:10,757
How long would you have to
stay down there?

1249
01:28:10,841 --> 01:28:12,801
Well, let's see now...

1250
01:28:14,928 --> 01:28:16,930
Cobalt Thorium G.

1251
01:28:27,858 --> 01:28:30,819
Radioactive half-life of...

1252
01:28:33,864 --> 01:28:37,326
I would think that possibly...

1253
01:28:37,409 --> 01:28:38,910
100 years.

1254
01:28:40,829 --> 01:28:44,875
You mean, people could actually
stay down there for a hundred years?

1255
01:28:44,958 --> 01:28:47,002
It would not be difficult, <i>mein Führer</i>.

1256
01:28:47,085 --> 01:28:49,004
Nuclear reactors could...

1257
01:28:49,087 --> 01:28:51,840
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1258
01:28:51,923 --> 01:28:55,761
Nuclear reactors could provide power
almost indefinitely.

1259
01:28:55,844 --> 01:28:58,597
Greenhouses could maintain plant life.

1260
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:01,600
Animals could be bred and slaughtered

1261
01:29:02,434 --> 01:29:06,897
A quick survey would have to be made
of all the available mine sites in the country,

1262
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:09,941
but I would guess that...

1263
01:29:10,025 --> 01:29:14,529
dwelling space for several hundred thousands
of our people could easily be provided.

1264
01:29:14,613 --> 01:29:20,535
Well, I would hate to have to decide
who stays up and who goes down.

1265
01:29:20,619 --> 01:29:23,413
Well, that would not
be necessary, Mr. President.

1266
01:29:24,664 --> 01:29:27,542
It could easily be accomplished
with a computer,

1267
01:29:27,626 --> 01:29:29,920
and the computer could be set
and programmed

1268
01:29:30,003 --> 01:29:35,967
to accept factors from youth, health,
sexual fertility, intelligence,

1269
01:29:36,051 --> 01:29:38,887
and a cross section
of necessary skills.

1270
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:41,223
Of course, it would be absolutely vital

1271
01:29:41,306 --> 01:29:45,185
that our top government
and military men be included

1272
01:29:45,268 --> 01:29:47,813
to foster and impart
the required principles

1273
01:29:47,896 --> 01:29:50,148
of leadership and tradition.

1274
01:29:56,154 --> 01:29:59,074
Naturally, they would breed
prodigiously?

1275
01:29:59,157 --> 01:30:01,993
There would be much time
and little to do.

1276
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:05,747
But with the proper breeding techniques

1277
01:30:05,831 --> 01:30:11,211
and a ratio of, say,
10 females to each male,

1278
01:30:11,294 --> 01:30:13,713
I would guess that they
could then work their way back

1279
01:30:13,797 --> 01:30:17,968
to the present gross national product
within, say, 20 years.

1280
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:22,347
But look here, Doctor,
wouldn't this nucleus of survivors

1281
01:30:22,431 --> 01:30:25,851
be so grief stricken and anguished
that they'd...

1282
01:30:26,893 --> 01:30:30,605
well, envy the dead
and not want to go on living?

1283
01:30:30,689 --> 01:30:33,442
And also... Excuse me.

1284
01:30:42,701 --> 01:30:46,788
Also, when they go down into the mine,
everyone would still be alive.

1285
01:30:46,872 --> 01:30:48,874
There will be no shocking memories,

1286
01:30:48,957 --> 01:30:53,628
and the prevailing emotion will be
one of nostalgia for those left behind,

1287
01:30:53,712 --> 01:30:59,009
combined with a spirit of bold curiosity
for the adventure ahead.

1288
01:31:16,610 --> 01:31:18,111
Doctor,

1289
01:31:20,739 --> 01:31:23,158
you mentioned the ratio

1290
01:31:23,241 --> 01:31:26,119
of 10 women to each man.

1291
01:31:26,203 --> 01:31:29,247
Now, wouldn't that necessitate
the abandonment

1292
01:31:29,331 --> 01:31:33,126
of the so-called monogamous
sexual relationship?

1293
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:36,421
I mean, as far
as men were concerned?

1294
01:31:36,505 --> 01:31:38,340
Regrettably, yes.

1295
01:31:38,423 --> 01:31:43,678
But it is, you know, a sacrifice required
for the future of the human race.

1296
01:31:43,762 --> 01:31:48,892
I hasten to add that since each man
will be required to do prodigious...

1297
01:31:50,644 --> 01:31:52,395
service along these lines,

1298
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:56,399
the women will have to be selected
for their sexual... characteristics,

1299
01:31:56,483 --> 01:32:00,278
which will have to be
of a highly stimulating nature.

1300
01:32:00,362 --> 01:32:04,241
I must confess, you have
an astonishingly good idea there, Doctor.

1301
01:32:05,617 --> 01:32:06,785
Thank you, sir.

1302
01:32:07,536 --> 01:32:11,331
I think we ought to look at this from
the military point of view. I mean...

1303
01:32:12,541 --> 01:32:16,962
supposing the Russkies stashed away
some big bombs, see, and we didn't.

1304
01:32:17,045 --> 01:32:19,923
When they come out in a hundred years,
they could take over.

1305
01:32:20,006 --> 01:32:21,550
I agree, Mr. President.

1306
01:32:21,633 --> 01:32:25,178
They might try an immediate sneak attack
so they could take over our mine shaft space.

1307
01:32:25,262 --> 01:32:28,056
Yeah. I think it would be
extremely naive of us, Mr. President,

1308
01:32:28,139 --> 01:32:31,017
to imagine that these new developments
are going to cause any change

1309
01:32:31,101 --> 01:32:33,061
in Soviet expansionist policy.

1310
01:32:33,144 --> 01:32:35,939
I mean, we must be
increasingly on the alert

1311
01:32:36,022 --> 01:32:38,567
to prevent them from taking over
other mine shaft space

1312
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:40,735
in order to breed more prodigiously
than we do,

1313
01:32:40,819 --> 01:32:43,738
thus knocking us out through
superior numbers when we emerge.

1314
01:32:43,822 --> 01:32:47,784
Mr. President,
we must not allow a mine shaft gap!

1315
01:32:47,867 --> 01:32:51,871
Sir, I have a plan.

1316
01:32:53,957 --> 01:32:56,167
<i>Mein Führer,</i>

1317
01:32:56,251 --> 01:32:58,003
I can walk!
